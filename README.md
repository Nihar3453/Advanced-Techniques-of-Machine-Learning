# Advanced-Techniques-of-Machine-Learning





This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks for key tasks in advanced machine learning techniques. It covers:



# Contents

-Autoencoder for MNIST:
Implement dimensionality reduction, image reconstruction, and denoising using autoencoders with the MNIST dataset.

-GAN for MNIST:
Build and train Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic handwritten digits and analyze the training process.

-WGAN for FashionMNIST:
Generate realistic FashionMNIST images using Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty, addressing GAN stability and sample quality.

-Siamese Networks (Difference Vector & Cosine Similarity):
Use Siamese architectures to learn image similarity, comparing pairs using difference vectors and cosine similarity metrics.

-AutoML Tabular Classification for Heart Disease:
Use AutoGluon to automate binary classification and risk prediction on heart disease medical data.

-AutoML Tabular Classification for Customer Churn:
Apply AutoGluon to automate churn prediction with feature engineering, model selection, and accuracy analysis on telecom datasets.

-Sequence-to-Sequence Models & Attention:
Implement encoder-decoder architectures for neural machine translation and text summarization, including attention mechanisms for improved results.

-Graph Neural Networks (GNN):
Apply GNN-based node classification, embedding, and social network analysis using real-world graph data.

The notebooks demonstrate building and training models, dataset preprocessing, architecture design, and evaluation techniques, suited for both tabular and image data tasks. They are ideal for educational use, research, and practical ML exploration.
