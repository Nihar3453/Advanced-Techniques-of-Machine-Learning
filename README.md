# Advanced-Techniques-of-Machine-Learning





This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks for key tasks in advanced machine learning using neural networks and graph-based models. It covers:

-Node classification using Graph Neural Networks (GCN)

-Image similarity detection with Siamese networks (difference vectors & cosine similarity)

-GAN and WGAN for synthetic image generation

-Neural machine translation and text summarization using LSTM Encoder-Decoder and Attention

-Binary classification and other deep learning workflows

The notebooks demonstrate building and training models, dataset preprocessing, architecture design, and evaluation techniques, suited for both tabular and image data tasks. They are ideal for educational use, research, and practical ML exploration.
